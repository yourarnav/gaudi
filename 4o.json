Best for smashes also for defensive players because of the light weight.\nFor a comparison between GForce 3800 and Nanoray light 18i definitely go for GForce if the price is less than nanoray. Both racket are best for offensive players that plays on back of the court. One of the con of this racket is the grip size because Li-Ning rackets has lower grip size. You can add external grips on this racket to make it easily movable.\nI give 5 stars to this racket because of the quality (Military Grade Corbon) and the string tention that is 30 for best performance and max-to-max 32 lbs.\nThat's it \ud83d\ude42\ud83d\ude42 I love this racket also Blue,Brown colous is the best ever racket colour I saw.",

            "Go for it , Display is awesome.\nSound is really good, Asus AI Noise Cancelling Feature is too good.",
            "This laptop has a fantastic display and performs very well. I have been using it for the past 2 months. Haven't noticed any lag or stuttering...works pretty well. I have played heavy games like Assassin's creed odessys and GTA V, it runs them smoothly and at very high graphics quality. The fps could have been at 120hz instead of 60hz but the oled display makes up for it. The battery life is around 5 and half to 6 hours on basic usage. If you use heavy applications, it will last around 4 hours. Overall, at this price, I would recommend this laptop. A laptop with RTX 3050, i5 12th gen and OLED display at 85k is a pretty good deal.",
            "Value for money.",
            "Display quality very good. performance very good. build quality very good. only sound loud ness very low but connect headphone or Bluetooth speaker sound quality very good.",
            "first of all it is a very well built laptop. I'm in love with this laptop. but for the price I think it is over priced. the performance is good but not but not ultimate, but time some bugs and lags have been faced but I think that its a windows bug. the weight is well distributed so it makes it easy to carry but the edges of the laptop are sharp so it is very uncomfortable to rest the hand on the edges and also uncomfortable to carry. then hinge quality is decent it can be opened with open hand but while typing it wobbles little bit and makes it uncomfortable. then about the display, it is the main reason for me to buy this laptop for this price, it is great and color accurate and detailed and 4k videos streaming in this is a delight but it is very glare a display so it makes it very annoying. the fan doesn't name noise. the type C port doesn't charge faster. still i didn't performed any GPU oriented tasks but I think that it could handle that. the keyboard experience is very decent and also same with the trackpad.\nthe ASUS link app makes it handy to share files from windows to phone but it is not optimized.\n\nif you are a student or a professional and searching for a laptop with this specs and should look professional and light weighted then you can consider this laptop.\u2764\ufe0f",
            "Capable product for coding, multitasking and gaming with good battery backup.",
            "The thing is the display is only 60Hz make sure u r okay with it. Good nits of brightness ,but It's been little annoying that it's glossy not antiglare.the light reflection is littles disturbing to work on it .if it's a deal breaker for u then u should go for ips- anti galre display I've seen Vivobook 16x in Asus store website around 79k is best replacement for this.if u r in not direct sun Light entering room it's fine. Battery is pretty good.over all nice product.",

        "product_opinion_summary": "The ASUS Vivobook Pro 15 OLED Intel Core i5 12th Gen 12450H Gaming Laptop is a powerhouse for both productivity and entertainment. Featuring a 15.6-inch FHD OLED display with a 1920 x 1080 pixel resolution, 16:9 aspect ratio, 600 nits HDR peak brightness, and 100% DCI-P3 color gamut, it delivers stunning visuals with deep blacks and vibrant colors, though the glossy screen can be reflective. Powered by a 12th Gen Intel Core i5 processor, 16 GB of LPDDR5 RAM, and a 512 GB SSD, this laptop ensures smooth multitasking and quick load times. The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050 GPU supports demanding games and creative tasks, making it a versatile choice. Its 70Whr battery provides up to 6 hours of basic usage, but heavy applications may reduce this to around 4 hours. The laptop is lightweight at 1.8 kg and has well-distributed weight, although the sharp edges may be uncomfortable for extended use. Connectivity options include Wi-Fi 6E, Bluetooth v5.2, and multiple USB ports: 1 x USB 3.2 Gen 1 Type-A, 2 x USB 2.0 Type-A, 1 x Thunderbolt 4 supporting display/power delivery, and 1 x HDMI 2.1 port. It comes with a 64-bit Windows 11 Operating System pre-installed. The backlit chiclet keyboard with a num-key and a 1080p FHD camera with a privacy shutter add to its user-friendly features. Users appreciate the solid build quality and performance, though some find the sound loudness lacking and the display's 60Hz refresh rate limiting for high-speed gaming. With an average rating of 4.4, the ASUS Vivobook Pro 15 OLED is a strong contender for those seeking a blend of power, portability, and impressive visuals."

            "Pros: 1) extra slot for 2.5 hdd is available.\n2) light weight considering for a gaming laptop.\n3)Great design\n4) good quality compared to my old lenovo g580\n5) office applications and other normal work would give 3hrs I think on full charge.\n\nCons:\n1) only One fan and so heating would be an issue if fan is set to 100%.. But may be want to 150% which is noisy\n2)keyboard is not a full one\n3)Can't play game for a full hour.. Battery will die.\n4)power button is not giving tactile feedback\n5)Very prone to oily or wet hands which would defiantly leave matk on metal cover on top and keyboard areas, Suggesting a vinyl skin. On top.\n6) If you are into mainly gaming, might want to buy an extra active cooling pad.\n7) 1650 is for basic gaming note it. PuBG plays well\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\n8) display is not Ips, only ips level. Red is not gonna view good.\n\nVerdict : light weight laptop for occasional or light game users as well as good performance i5. If gamming is only concern go for Bravo15 which has two fans and slight better battery i think but at a slight increase in weight.I wanted light weight.",
            "Gaming is just osm and it is best for Daily usage.\nI have tried GTA V just one problem that is little heat but mind-blowing product.",
            "Well the laptop is quite good for some specific uses and it could suit you better if you know what kind of laptop you actually want.",
            "Overall good but battery drain quickly",
            "Product Is Good For Me Right Now I will esit review after longtime Usage with Pros and Cons.",
            "Good to use for normal computer things like working, surfing, listening music or to play light games . Because once you start playing heavy games like COD, or Warfare .. the laptop heats to the top level where it can burn your hand, fan speed noise irritates and battery dont lasts for long. so not recommended for gaming and dont write its a gaming laptop.. its just normal general fast performance laptop. I am unsatisfied because my purpose was to play high definition games but I am not able to play even for an hr due to excess heating.",
            "My second MSI laptop. MSI never disappointed me ever. Amazing performance and budget friendly,and  no other company beat the build quality. One is the reason I fell in love with that. Blindly go for it.",
            "Good",
            "15 Day's Review.\n\nHardcore gamers can face little overheating issue.\nDesign editing and other stuffs works great on it.\n\nWill edit proper review after one month again.",

        "product_opinion_summary": "The MSI GF63 Thin 11SC-1400IN Intel Core i5 11th Gen Gaming Laptop offers a compelling blend of performance and portability for both gamers and professionals. Equipped with a GeForce GTX 1650 graphics card and Intel's 11th Gen Core i5 processor, it provides smooth gameplay and efficient multitasking. The laptop features a 15.6-inch Full HD display with a 1920 x 1080 pixel resolution and a 60Hz refresh rate, delivering clear and vibrant visuals. With 16GB DDR4 RAM, expandable up to 64GB, and a 512GB SSD, expandable up to 4TB, it ensures quick boot times and ample storage. Despite its powerful specs, the laptop is lightweight at 1.86 kg, making it easy to carry around. Users appreciate its quiet and cool operation, though the single fan can lead to overheating during intense gaming sessions. The single backlit keyboard (red) enhances usability in low-light conditions, and the HD webcam (30fps@720p) provides clear video quality. Connectivity options include Wi-Fi 6, Bluetooth v5.2, and multiple USB ports: 1 x Type-C USB3.2 Gen1 and 3 x Type-A USB3.2 Gen1. The laptop's sturdy audio system delivers exceptional sound quality, enhancing the overall user experience. The battery life is a mixed bag, offering up to 3 hours of usage on a full charge, which may be insufficient for long gaming sessions. Additionally, the laptop's design is sleek but prone to fingerprints and smudges. Users have noted the good build quality and sound system, although the sound loudness could be improved.

Overall, with an average rating of 4.4, the MSI GF63 Thin 11SC-1400IN is a solid choice for those seeking a budget-friendly, high-performance laptop for casual gaming and everyday use."

            "Never expected this from Samsung. No adapter, no case was still OK, but  performance wise it's a real disappointment. While fingerprint sensor is fine, phone's touch lags, many a time you have to tap twice to open an app. When three finger screenshot is best you are bound to press power and sound button simultaneously to take screen shot, don't know if Samsung has made those buttons that sturdy for quick and repeated use. Camera quality is not upto the mark, whether front or rear. Design is same orthodox and RAM plus feature remains a mystery. Phone lags a lot, most importantly  don't rely on Flipkart's exchange offer of product being picked after 10 days, it's complete fraud. After 10 days they are telling there was nothing like this.",

            "1.Camera quality is avarage 7/10\n2. Video quality is better with 4k with 60fps 8/10.\n3.Video stabilization is awesome \ud83d\udc4c 9/10.",
            "I love the overall design, but I hate it because it gets hot real quick . Overall it ok",
            "Display:\nThe display has a Super Amoled Panel. It has a fast refresh rate of 120hz. The colors are saturated as usual in a Super Amoled panel. The display is very bright as well. It is very smooth. But there is always stutter because of the Adaptive Refresh Rate.\n\nUI:\nPacked of features. There is no doubt that Samsung is one of the best UI out there for Android.\n\nBattery:\nThe phone has 4500mah. Easily lasts a day. Could last even longer if used in 60hz. The phone supports upto 25w charging. It also supports reverse charging. It even supports reverse wireless charging!!\n\nPerformance: A top of the line processor by Samsung. Would've been better if the indian version had gotten the Snapdragon 865 chipset. But the 5g Version does have SD 865 but it is much more costlier.\n\nCamera:\nThe camera sure is 12MP but it takes much more details than expected by a 12MP camera. It is a very capable capable unit under bright environments. But you can see lots of noise in dark environments.",
            "It is a good mobile with decent battery life.\nIn the beginning the battery dies fast, but after a few days it ges better. I think because of all the updates the battery gets drained very fast.\n\nCamera is really good. Buy it for the camera.",
            "Great delivery and awesome condition with best market price very much satisfied",
            "Display and Camera have top notch quality.\n\nBattery was an issue during the setup. Once my phone was completely set up with all the apps, now the back up has improved\n*Tip : Put your phone in Medium Power Saving Mode and you are good to go.\nI get one day battery backup with normal usage.\n*Note : I don't play games on this device since it is my work phone. Rest of the business apps, calls and camera is used regularly.\n\nPerformance is quite okay. Nothing to complain there.\n\nBuild quality is great. Just that the back is plastic. But the sides and front seems solid.\n\nIt is a 4G phone so do keep that in mind.\n\nCurrently on Android 10 and won't be upgrading it since I have experienced that upgrading the phone will actually slow it down and drain the battery.\n\nThis is a good midrange phone and I do recommend this.\nBattery can be optimised. Performance is okay. Camera and display is best in class.\n\nP.S.  Do not compare it with iPhone. I saw people comparing this phone with iPhone 11/12 on YouTube. Please... this phone comes nowhere. I have iPhone 11 and it is better than this device in all the possible ways.",
            "Battery drain very fast & heating issue",
            "Heating issue\nPhone started heating within 5 mins of use. Also Battery drains faster. Do not buy this phone.",
            "Battery is not good  also 15w charger. Phone is heating While using. After taking images no zooming clarity.",
            "I have owned this model since it was launched in India.\n\nMy biggest concern has been battery life. I have been extremely disappointed with it as I wasn't able to make it last through the day. The system needs a month or more to understand my usage and optimise battery usage. \n\nI am always (and I mean all the time) on Bluetooth and WiFi as I work from home. I listen to music all the time. The phone last 6 hours on average. This is far better than the battery life I had at the beginning.\n\nI cannot talk about the camera much as I rarely use it. It's serviceable. \n\nThe screen auto brightness setting is very aggressive sometimes. Dims the screen when it needs to be bright.\n\nThe fingerprint scanner is better but becomes unresponsive sometimes. Face recognition is pathetic.\n\nSoftware is solid. I have Android 11 and things have gotten better. \n\nWould I recommend it to people? Absolutely not for 41k. It's a phone that should be sold for 35k. It becomes a compelling buy at that point.\n\nI would give this phone 3.5 stars out of 5. I have given it a liberal 4 stars here."

            "This is my personal opinion of the Vivo V27, based on the experience of using it for the past 15 days.\n\nPros:\n\nGood primary camera with high resolution and pro mode, which clicks good HD photos.\n\nFront camera is also good, with much clarity.\n\nNo lag as of now, indicating good performance.\n\nLight weight, making it easy to carry around.\n\nCons:\n\nBattery could have been bigger, indicating that we might need to charge it more frequently than you'd like, if we use internet often. Without the usage of 5g internet, battery might hold longer.\n\nOverall, you find it to be a decent mobile phone for its price range of 30-37k. Additionally, I was able to get a good deal on it, thanks to the exchange bonus and credit card offer, which made the purchase even more attractive. \nThis is about my thoughts and experiences with the Vivo V27.\n\n- PRV",

            "Its been 4 days I'm using this phone of 12 GB variant.\n\nGot open box delivery. (I checked all the contents of the phone ,then I gave delivery OTP). \n\n7 plus gen 2 is fabulous processor I must say. Superb speed no doubt. \n\nI ran Antutu version 10 and tested in normal outdoor (heat) condition and indoor (18 degree AC) condition. \n\nOutdoor I got a score of 1089836 and indoor of 1120582. And thats fantastic. \n\nCamera is decent, not too good but not bad at all. I don't know why people want DSLR quality from this phone .I personally liked it. (Selfie and back photo attached) . \n\nUsing MIUI is also very exciting and I felt no issues using it. (I Switched from One UI) \n\nAnyone who needs moderate to heavy usage without lag and decent camera, go for it. \n\nFinger's crossed after update though. But I trust Poco will not screw up this time. \n\nLittle heating happens when charging. Long battery life. \n\nWill update review after a month. \n\n5G speed is good. \n\nNice phone!\n\nUpdate after 2 Months : No issues at all. Best performance. Playing heavy games with no issues. Go for it.",

            "After seeing a lot of reviews i was expecting a sub par camera. But it surprised me. Photos came out to be decent. Not exceptional by any means but ok.\nThe phone is well built and firm. I chose white but now regret it because I like the black one more.\nPerformance is exceptional. Ui is snappy and fluid. Miui comes with a ton of customisation and bloatware \ud83d\ude05. I uninstalled most of them, which gave me a premium experience.\nI didn't find the display to be as good. I could sometimes make out the individual pixels (only when I'm looking for it) which is odd because I was using a redmi note 8 before and I haven't experienced any such issues with it. \nBattery life is phenomenal. Even with 5g and bgmi I endup having about 40% battery left. (Phone was in balanced mode, refresh rate set to automatic and on 5G network.)\nSpeakers are okay, nothing commendable there. Maybe i was expecting more because of all the Dolby Atmos branding. \nOverall for an average user who prioritises performance over camera, poco F5 delivers. I'm happy with the purchase with a slight regret that I didn't go for the black one.\nfingers crossed for the motherboard\ud83e\udd72\ud83d\ude35",
